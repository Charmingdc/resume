## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting this resume template up and running locally is super easy! Just follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you'll want to grab a copy of the project files. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/resume.git
```

This command will create a new directory named `resume` on your machine, containing all the project files.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd resume
```

### 3. Open in Your Browser

Since this is a static HTML project, there's no complex build process! Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by:

-   **Double-clicking** on `index.html` from your file explorer.
-   **Right-clicking** on `index.html` and choosing "Open with" your preferred web browser.

Alternatively, you can serve it with a simple local server for better practice, for example, using Python's http.server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open your browser to http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## üí° Usage

This template is designed for easy personalization. To make it your own, you'll need to directly edit the HTML files.

### Customizing Your Resume

1.  **Choose Your Template:**
    *   `index.html`: This is the main, generic template.
    *   `resumes/frontend-resume.html`: This includes specific content for Adebayo Muis's frontend profile and can serve as an excellent example of how to structure your own resume.

2.  **Open the HTML File:** Use your favorite code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom) to open `index.html` or `resumes/frontend-resume.html`.

3.  **Edit Content:**
    *   **Your Name:** Locate the `<h1>Your Name</h1>` tag and replace "Your Name" with your actual name. For `frontend-resume.html`, you'll see `<h1>ADEBAYO MUIS</h1>`.
    *   **Contact Information:** Update the `div` with class `contact`. Replace placeholder links and text for LinkedIn, phone number, email, and GitHub with your personal details.
    *   **Professional Summary:** Fill in a concise summary of your experience, skills, and career aspirations within the `<p>` tag under `<h2>Professional Summary</h2>`.
    *   **Skills:** Categorize and list your technical skills under `<h2>Skills</h2>`. The template provides examples for Frontend, Backend, and Tools.
    *   **Education:** Detail your academic background, including your university, degree program, and relevant coursework under `<h2>Education</h2>`.
    *   **Projects Experience:** This is a crucial section!
        *   Each project is represented by an `<h3>` tag (for the title and link) and an `<ul>` list for bullet points.
        *   **Project Title:** Update `<a href="#" target="_blank">Project Title 1</a>` with your project's name and a link to its live demo or repository.
        *   **Role & Dates:** Modify the `<div class="meta">Your Role | MM/YYYY ‚Äì MM/YYYY</div>` to reflect your contribution and the project timeline.
        *   **Description:** Use the `<li>` items to highlight what you built, technologies used, your achievements, and any significant challenges or solutions. Be specific and quantify results where possible.
    *   **Honors & Awards:** If applicable, list any awards, scholarships, or notable achievements under `<h2>Honors & Awards</h2>`.

4.  **Save Your Changes:** Remember to save the HTML file after making your edits.
