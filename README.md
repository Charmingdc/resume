Welcome to the Professional Resume Templates project! This repository offers a collection of clean, modern, and highly customizable HTML templates designed to help you craft an impactful resume. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a fresh graduate, these templates provide a solid foundation to highlight your skills and experience effectively.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Setting up these resume templates on your local machine is super straightforward. Just follow these steps to get a copy up and running for your personal use!

### Prerequisites

You just need a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari) to view and edit these templates. No complex dependencies here!

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:Charmingdc/resume
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Change into the newly created project folder:
    ```bash
    cd resume
    ```
3.  **Open the Template**:
    Simply open the desired HTML file in your web browser. You can typically do this by double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with" your preferred browser.
    *   For the generic template: `template.html`
    *   For the frontend-specific example: `resumes/frontend-resume.html`

That's it! Your resume template should now be visible in your browser.

## üìù Usage

These templates are designed to be easily editable directly within the HTML file.

1.  **Open in a Text Editor**:
    Open either `template.html` or `resumes/frontend-resume.html` using your favorite code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom).
2.  **Customize Your Information**:
    Go through the HTML file and replace the placeholder content with your own details:
    *   **Name and Contact Information**: Update the `<h1>` tag and the `contact` div with your name, phone number, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links.
    *   **Professional Summary**: Write a concise summary of your skills and career aspirations in the `<p>` tag under the "Professional Summary" heading.
    *   **Skills**: List your technical proficiencies under the "Skills" section, categorized by frontend, backend, tools, etc.
    *   **Education**: Provide details about your academic background, including your university, degree, and relevant coursework.
    *   **Projects Experience**: Fill in your project titles, roles, dates, and key achievements using the provided list (`<ul>`) format. Make sure to link your project if it's live!
    *   **Honors & Awards**: Document any significant achievements or recognition you've received.
3.  **Update Links and Paths**:
    Ensure all `href` attributes for links (LinkedIn, GitHub, project links) are updated to your personal URLs. If you add custom icons, make sure their `src` paths are correct.
4.  **Save and View**:
    Save your changes in the text editor and refresh your browser page to see your updated resume.
5.  **Print/Export**:
    Once satisfied, you can use your browser's print function (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`) to save the resume as a PDF. Choose "Save as PDF" from the printer options for a professional-looking document.
