## Usage ‚úçÔ∏è

This template is designed for straightforward content customization. All your information is stored directly within the `index.html` file, making edits super easy.

1.  **Edit Your Content**: Open `index.html` in your favorite code editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom).
    *   **Personal Information**: Update `FIRSTNAME LASTNAME`, `YOUR JOB ROLE`, and your contact details (LinkedIn, phone, email, GitHub, portfolio links) at the top of the file.
    *   **Professional Summary**: Modify the `<p>` tag under the "Professional Summary" heading to reflect your unique experience and aspirations.
    *   **Skills**: Adjust the "Skills" section to list your core competencies, categorizing them into Frontend, Backend, Tools, etc.
    *   **Education**: Fill in your university, degree program, graduation year, and any relevant coursework.
    *   **Projects Experience**: Each project is an `<h3>` and `<ul>` block. Update the project title, technologies, your role, dates, and bullet points describing your contributions and achievements. You can add or remove projects as needed.
    *   **Honors & Awards**: Populate this section with any accolades or recognitions you've received.

2.  **Update Links and Icons**:
    *   Ensure all `<a>` tags for your social media and portfolio links point to your actual profiles.
    *   The template references icon images (`./icons/*.png`). If you move the `index.html` file or deploy it, make sure these paths are correct or include your own icons.

3.  **Save Your Changes**: After making your edits, save the `index.html` file. Simply refresh your browser tab, and you'll see your updated resume!

4.  **Print to PDF (Optional)**: Most modern browsers allow you to "Print to PDF." This is a great way to generate a printable version of your resume that retains the web styling.

## Features ‚ú®

*   **Easy Customization**: All content is directly editable within the HTML, no complex frameworks or build steps required.
